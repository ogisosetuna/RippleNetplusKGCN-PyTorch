RippleNet is a deep end-to-end model that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems.
Ripple Network overcomes the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based KG-aware recommendation methods by introducing preference propagation, which automatically propagates users' potential preferences and explores their hierarchical interests in the KG.
